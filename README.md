# cpp_genetic_algorithms
A (hopefully) lightweight (enough) library for easy use of genetic algorithms in c++

## Compatibality
This library does not work with the technologies listed below:
* C:
  * Because it does not support lambda functions or classes.
* C++98:
  * Because it does not support lambda functions.

## Features
* Data normalization functions (sigmoid, relu, etc..)
* Heavily dynamic (thanks to OOP)
* No need for extra libraries, as it is not reliant on 3rd party c++ libs.
* Support for JSON saving/loading.
* Open source (duh) and open to changes.
